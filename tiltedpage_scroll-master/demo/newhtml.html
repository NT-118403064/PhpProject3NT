        <h2>Blockchain</h2>
        <p>Blockchain is an advanced way of logging and protecting data and changes to a decentralised database that makes it impossible to change or hack.<br> It's the technology that underpins digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, helping to protect against double-spending and hyperinflation in banking, and helping achieve automated supply chain management in manufacturing.<br>
            Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, one that operates as a public platform of data records that doesn't "belong" to anyone. It allows people to exchange information in real-time, with that information changing hands multiple times at once, while being verified by the technology to ensure it's legitimate.<br> Blockchain is one of the most advanced technologies around, mainly because it has to do so many things at once too ensure that wherever the information resides, it's correct and everyone can see the same information.
Data resides in a limited number of "blocks" that together make up a "chain", hence the name Blockchain. Any data sent or received over the chain of data blocks can be viewed by any person, at any time, and any changes are confirmed and uploaded at the same time. But because it doesn't reside in a single location, such as a database or server, it means it's incredibly difficult to disrupt or hack - this would require every single node supporting the network to be compromised at the same time.

Although originally developed for digital currencies, businesses are now seeing the benefits of implementing forms of distributed ledgers into their organisation, particularly to protect secure data in environments such as hospitals or by estate agents to secure property purchases.</p>

        <h2>Autonomous Things</h2>
        <p>The emergence of autonomous things over the last few years, I believe, has been an exciting development within technology that is only going to become more innovative and more and more exciting as time goes on.<br> Driven by the likes of big data, AI and cloud technologies, I have no doubt that – as these technologies advance – autonomous things are only going to continue to advance at a break neck speed.</p>
        <p>Autonomous vehicles are constantly collecting data from their environment; such as the road conditions, potential hazards, pedestrians, surrounding vehicles and even storing the routes and roads themselves. In order for these vehicles to become safer they rely on a vast amounts of software and the collection of vast amounts of data to train the artificial intelligence to ensure the safety of their passengers without humans having to intervene.<br> I have read a stat that says these vehicles exchange around 15,000 pieces of data within a tenth of a second, this is a figure that could rise to 200,000 pieces of data by 2020. That’s pretty quick, if you ask me.

        <h2>Immersive Experience</h2>
        <p>Immersive technologies such as virtual and augmented reality are currently taking the world by storm. Over the past three years, we’ve seen a huge interest in immersive technologies from the likes of advertising agencies, games developers, construction companies and more…</p>
        <p>Immersive technology is not a new concept. Experimentation with virtual and augmented reality has been taking place since the 1960s, hidden inside research facilities across the world. The Sword of Damocles is considered by most to be one of the first virtual reality headsets.<br> Built by Ivan Southerland and Bob Sproull in a laboratory at MIT, it was a large and somewhat dystopian looking device. The device was so heavy that it had to mounted to a mechanical arm attached to the ceiling when in use.</p>
