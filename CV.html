            <div class="subheading mb-3">Rumley's open Farm</div>
            <p> I am responsibile for overseeing and leading the work and performance of the group of employees in the cafe and shop of this open farm. I guide and monitor those that report back to me and I am ultimately responsible for resolving the everyday issues faced within the business.I motivate and communicate in order to mold staffers into cooperative teams and to convey information continually up, down, and around the organization to ensure the smooth running of the business. I have developed and improved many essential skills such as communication skills, managing skills and teamwork skills. I have progressed massively from being a waitress to now being the manager and most experienced employee in this business. Throughout my years here I have worked with many customers at all ages including kids, adults, kids and adults with special needs and eldery customers. I am highly capable of adapting to unusual situations and circumstances, particularly medical ones as many children and eldery in particular tend to injure themselves during their trip. I have gained massive confidence and strongly feel that i can tackle any problem with a clear, calm and logical mindset. </p>

            <p>Here I gained experience in taking orders from guests and delivering their food while portraying a high degree of multi-tasking to keep up with a wide range of expectations. I had to always be aware of guest satisfaction to deliver the perfect service experience making guests feel welcome, comfortable and well attended to at all times. From working here i developed great multi-tasking skills, communication skills and gained knowledge of food, beverages and hygeine. I have the ability to perform well in a fast-paced environment and have hands-on experience with cash register and ordering information systems.</p>

From this experience i gained great experience working with children as well as developing organisational, communication and leadership skills. I showed great enthusiasm, patience and understanding as while as drive and a hunger to learn.  </p>
